# Weekly Assignment Instructions


### Overview

    In this assignment we will further practice state management through useState, useEffect, and useReducer in ReactJS!

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to read/write code with state, effect, and reducers in ReactJS.  You will also be able to write your own functional components that utilize these concepts!
 

### Instructions
1. **Review the following materials**:

   - [ReactJS useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)

        This article covers the "useState" functionality you will already be familiar with from weeks one and two!

   - [ReactJS useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)

        This article covers the "useEffect" functionality you have already been familiarized with from weeks one and two!

   - [ReactJS useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)

        ReactJS documentation regarding useReducer.  This is a concept imported from the "Redux" project [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) which is a widely used "state management" toolkit for ReactJS.  

   - [useReducer video](https://youtu.be/rgp_iCVS8ys?si=oqOXiicIqnegditE)

3. **Complete the following tasks**:
   - Please complete the "UseStateCounter.jsx" and "UseReducerCounter.jsx" so that you can increase, decrease, or reset the counters to 0 by using the buttons!  Please use "state" functionality in the UseStateCounter and use "reducer" functionality in the UseReducercounter!
   
4. **Please commit your code to a public GitHub repository**

    - Once you have completed all three tasks in your code please commit your updated code to a public repository in GitHub!
    - Once you have a public repository link submit that link to the week one assignment in Brightspace!
